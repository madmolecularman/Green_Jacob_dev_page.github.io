## Bio

**Who am I?**

I am a PhD candidate at the University of Rhode Island in the Biological and Environmental Sciences program with a specialization in Evolution and Marine Biology. I am currently researching in the Puritz lab developing a de novo Exome sequencing and assembly pipeline. My research interests are in bioinformatics development, marine ecology and evolution, molecular cellular and developmental biology, biological chemical and physical oceanography, disease epidemiology, and ocean climatology.
